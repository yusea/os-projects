// REAMDME for PJ1

1.create the procinfo strct in procinfo.c
2.write int getprocsinfo(struct procinfo*) in proc.c
3.write a sys edition getprocsinfo in sysproc.c
4.link func and struct in several files, syscall.c ect.
5.write a test in testgetprocsinfo.c
6.Modified Makefile

Just add a function of syscall, get info from ptable, //
and does not have any change on other func and status.
So it has small effect on overhead.
